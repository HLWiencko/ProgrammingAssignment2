## A pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix. 

## Creates a "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Gets the inverse of the "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix
## If the inverse has already been calculated and the matrix has
## not changed, retrieve the cached inverse. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
